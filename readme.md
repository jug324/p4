# Description
This final project is an application to help create and save characters for use in a (theoretical) role playing game based in Farenia, a fictional world I created for my novel series. Users are able to customize and save a roster of characters as well as few characters created by other users.

# Demo

# Details for teaching team
Since the game itself is only theoretical, character creation only has a limited number of customizable fields, but it still gives a sense of what is possible.
HTML validates.

# Outside code
I borrowed code from the walkthrough on password resets by Philip Brown.
